    <p>
      A great way to make stuffed goose. It is similar to a turkey, but a much
      richer-tasting bird. Incredibly good!

      <li>1 teaspoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>¼ cup water (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions :</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Make the stuffing: Combine bread, apples, currants, butter, thyme, salt,
        and pepper in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the goose: Wash inside and out. Pat dry. Stuff with stuffing
        mix, truss, and tie goose. Prick bird all over with fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a roasting pan on top of the stove. Brown goose lightly on
        all sides, then drain off pan drippings. Set goose breast side up in the
        roasting pan. Add a little water, cover, and roast in the preheated oven
        for 1 hour. Discard fat from the roasting pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine onion, carrot, celery, garlic, bay leaf, cloves, fresh thyme,
        and marjoram in a mixing bowl and sprinkle around the goose.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue roasting uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes per pound, draining off
        fat at intervals. Add more water as required.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer cooked goose to a platter and keep warm by covering loosely
        with foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the gravy: Skim off remaining fat in pan and heat drippings and
        vegetables on top of stove until mixture is reduced. Stir in chicken
        broth, white wine, and tomato paste. Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, then
        strain gravy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix water and cornstarch in a small bowl. Add cornstarch mix, a little
        at a time, to thicken the gravy if necessary.
      </li>
    </ol>
