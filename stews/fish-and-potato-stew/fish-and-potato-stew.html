      <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
      <li>½ cup pitted black olives</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian plum tomatoes, chopped</li>
      <li>½ cup white wine</li>
      <li>½ cup fish stock</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 ¼ pounds whitefish fillets, skinned and deboned</li>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a
        boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20
        minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in onion, olives, and
        garlic. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned
        translucent, about 5 minutes. Add cooked potatoes, tomatoes, wine, fish
        stock, and tomato paste. Mix well and bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Taste and season with
        salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add fish fillets. Mix carefully and simmer until fish flakes easily with
        a fork, about 4 minutes.
